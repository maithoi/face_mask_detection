# REAL-TIME FACE-MASK DETECTION ON VIDEO 
***Phát hiện đeo khẩu trang trên video sử dụng kỹ thuật học sâu.*** 

## Abstract
In the context of the Covid-19 pandemic that is developing very complicatedly, the disease is spreading rapidly in the community. According to the 5K recommendation of the Ministry of Health, Wearing a mask in public helps to prevent the spreading. However, monitoring the enforcement of mask-wearing in public places requires a lot of human resources and expensive operating costs. Therefore, the development of automatic surveillance systems capable of automatically detecting mask-wearing is very urgent. From that urgency, the thesis proposes an real-time automatic mask-wearing detection method on video data and classifies mask-wearing subjects into 3 classes: wearing a mask, not wearing a mask, and wearing the mask incorrectly.
To solve the proposed thesis problem, I have approached the problem by building a YOLOv4 algorithm model using the Darnet library on the Google Colab platform.
After the process of experimentation and evaluation, I have successfully built a YOLOv4 algorithm model capable of detecting automatic mask-wearing on video for 3 groups of subjects as mentioned in the thesis problem. The developed model achieves up to 80.7% accuracy and achieves up to 15 FPS prediction rate on Tesla T4 GPU.
